## Overview 
The ANN is run entirely by the MATLAB/Octave script in this folder. It was created using GNU Octave 4.0.0. Summary statistics are written to a CSV file and plots are written to PDFs. 

## Requirements 
The provided data set must be contained in the same directory as the script. All output files will also be written to this directory. 

## To Run 
Run the `ANN.m` script in this directory as you would any other MATLAB/Octave script. Ensure that the iris.data.txt file is in the same directory. All output will be written to this directory as well.
